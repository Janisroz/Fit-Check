# Fit Check

Fit Check is a fitness checker built using Python. It takes inputs from the user gathering specific data and returns information and recommendations based on the information provided.

The user inputs information throughout the program and their Body Mass Index (BMI) and recommended calories are calculated based on their inputs.

A workout plan is then recommended to them based on their results.

## UX & Design 

### User Stories

As a user,

* I would like to find out my BMI without having to do any calculations
* I would like to find out my daily recommended calories without having to do any calculations 
* I would like to see errors and reasoning if there is issues with my inputs
* I would like to get a recoommended weekly workout plan that suits my needs

### Logic Flow

To plan the logic flow of the program, a diagram was generated detailing each step of the program. A key is given to distinguish the different types of steps
